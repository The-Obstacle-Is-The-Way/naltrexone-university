## Stem

A patient with opioid use disorder wants to start oral naltrexone. Which statement is most accurate regarding timing relative to last opioid use?

## Explanation

Because naltrexone is an opioid antagonist, starting it too soon after opioid use can precipitate withdrawal. An opioid-free interval (often verified clinically and sometimes with a challenge test) is typically required.
