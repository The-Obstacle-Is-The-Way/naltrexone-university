## Stem

A 29-year-old patient asks about starting naltrexone for alcohol use disorder. Which statement best describes naltrexone’s mechanism of action?

## Explanation

Naltrexone is a **competitive opioid receptor antagonist**. In alcohol use disorder it is thought to reduce the rewarding effects/craving in part through opioid system modulation.
