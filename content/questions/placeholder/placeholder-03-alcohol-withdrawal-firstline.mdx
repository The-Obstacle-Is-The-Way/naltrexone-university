## Stem

A 45-year-old patient presents with tremor, diaphoresis, and tachycardia 12 hours after last drink. What is the first-line pharmacologic treatment for alcohol withdrawal syndrome?

## Explanation

Benzodiazepines are first-line for alcohol withdrawal because they reduce the risk of seizures and delirium tremens through GABA-A receptor modulation.
