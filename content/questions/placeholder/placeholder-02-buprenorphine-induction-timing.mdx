## Stem

A 34-year-old patient with opioid use disorder using fentanyl daily requests buprenorphine. They last used fentanyl 6 hours ago and have mild rhinorrhea but no objective withdrawal. What is the best next step to reduce the risk of precipitated withdrawal?

## Explanation

Buprenorphine is a partial agonist with high receptor affinity. Starting too early can displace full agonists and precipitate withdrawal. Initiation is safest when the patient is in **moderate** withdrawal, or via a micro-induction protocol (not covered in this placeholder question).
