## Stem

Which statement best reflects DSM-5 conceptual domains for opioid use disorder criteria?

## Explanation

DSM-5 substance use disorders include criteria spanning impaired control, social impairment, risky use, and pharmacologic criteria (tolerance/withdrawal). In some contexts (e.g., prescribed opioids taken as directed), tolerance and withdrawal alone do not necessarily indicate a substance use disorder.
